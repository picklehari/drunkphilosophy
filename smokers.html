            <h3 class="post-headers">Generosity</h3>
            <p class="post">You rarely see people split bills for cigarettes. This doesn't happen for anything else. You don't see people giving away free beer. But people lighting cigarettes for others , a very common scene .</p>
            <h3 class="post-headers">Carefree-ness</h3>
            <p class="post">Smokers know very well the affects of smoking and that it could kill them brutally. Yet smokers tend to slowly increase the amount they smoke and tend to buy cheaper cigarettes while counting down their days to live. They don't care about police fining them, they stop and smoke wherever they feel like. In the middle of a highway, in-front of an hospital and everything.  They are very carefree while plotting their own death.</p>
            <h3 class="post-headers">Perseverance</h3>
            <p class="post">Most chain-smokers you know are on the verge of quitting. They buy nicotine patches and smoking cigarettes. It's basically the equivalent of buying a mask and cutting holes in it.</p>
            <h3 class="post-headers">Extremely good at excuses</h3>
            <p class="post">Smokers become extremely good at excuses . They claim it helps them calm down and increases their creativity. Only to find themselves sitting in front of a screen writing an 'original' article that is awfully similar to the ones you read in Buzzfeed for instance this one .</p>
